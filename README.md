# NIPLs (NIP collection by Lez)

NIPLs are [NIPs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips).
NIPLs are apocryphal (see [ANIPs](https://github.com/arthurfranca/anips)).

This just means that these specs will not necessarily be evaluated
by the main repo maintainers.

Nevertheless, they are grouped here to let ideas flow.

## PRs welcome!

Create a Pull Request if you have a NIP that wasn't merged by the core devs,
but you feel it needs a home on the Internet.

I will merge anything that is not utter bs, has some original thought,
or it addresses real / interesting problems in a decentralized way.

Expect chaos.
